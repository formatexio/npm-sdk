## Scope

This SDK is a thin HTTP client. The attack surface is limited to:

- API key handling (keys are never logged or stored by the SDK)
- HTTP requests to `api.formatex.io` only
- Parsing of API responses

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in the FormaTex API service itself (report those at security@formatex.io separately).
